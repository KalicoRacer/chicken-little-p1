# Chicken Little's Falling Acorn Project
# In this project, we will use NASA's data on falling metorite to answer a few questions. 
# What year did we see/found the most Meteorite? 
# Using various maps and plots, we will visualize the geographic region with the most meteorite findings. 
# We will try to find out how many metorite fell/found within a 500 miles radius of a particular City.
